	//  ~map of Babylon with triangle pointing from Urartu / Mt. Ararat 
	// 	"To the fourth, to which you must travel seven leagues" 					0.7*10^4 = 7000  -> 5,700 lightyears away: Eagle Nebula containing the "pillars of creation"
	//  "as thick as a parsiktu-vessel... fingers" 									associated to Babyloninan Noah's ark story via "parsiktu"; only known word match 
	//  															                Pillars of creation : parsiktu (look like broken DNA base pair structure);
	//
	//  "To the fifth, to which you must travel seven leagues..."                   0.7*10^5 = 70000  -> ~70,000 light years in radius is the luminous part of Milky Way
	//  "The Great Wall, its height is 840 cubits..."								A wall-like structure (Milky Way)
	//  "its trees up to 120 cubits..."												840*120=100800; tree rings: 100800/360 = 280 rotations
	//  "by day you can't see in front of yourself"									8    20 
	//  "by night, lying in..."														  
	//  "you must go another seven leagues"											through the opposite radius length : 70000 lightyears
	//  "in the sand you must..."													through the stars (70000+70000 = 140000 light years)  
	//
	//  "To the third, to which you must travel seven Leagues..."                   0.7*10^3 = 700  -> 450 lightyears away: Pleiades cluster
	//  "... where winged birds cannot flap their own wings ..."					*Known to Babylonians: ("where winged birds": Near ecliptic line (path of planets that move), "cannot flap their own wings"  Pleiades is static in comparison)

	//
	// "To the seventh, to which you must travel seven Leagues..."					0.7*10^7 = 7,000,000  -> 3,000,000 lightyears away: Messier 33 (Triangulum Galaxy)
	//  "oxen with horns"															Located in constellation Triangulum. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy.
	//	"They can run fast enough to catch wild animals ..."						First Quasar ever observed, accretion disk runs fast, black hole "catch wild animals"
	//
	// "To the eighth, to which you must travel seven Leagues..."					0.7*10^8 = 70,000,000  -> 35,000,000 lightyears away: Leo Triplet                                                                                                
	// "the Very Hairy One comes out of his gate. " 								"the Very Hairy One", Leo 1 set of 3, "comes out of his gate", near the tail as the rest of Leo has passed through the time period
	//																				"Messier 65, Messier 66, and NGC 3628 form the Leo Triplet, located in Leo. A common target for astronomers, 1700s telescope tech."
	//  ~Scribe is "Issuru" : bird -> looking through the sky like a bird (son of the astronomer)
	//
	//  Cultural relation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomical_diaries
	//  Technological feasability: A. "The Eagle Nebula is relatively bright compared to many other nebulae. It has an apparent magnitude of about 6.0, which means it can be seen with a telescope or binoculars under dark skies."	
	//   						   B. Speed of light measurement: Tablet of Shamash (Sun god) -> https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1881-0428-34-a#:~:text=Inscription%20translation%3A%20(1)%20Shamash,10)%20his%20figure%20and%20his
	// 							    columns 1-3: 31+30+30 = 91 total rows
	//								columns 4-6: 55+55+55 = 165 total rows
	//								165/91 = 1.813186...  *note: 318 = Helios (Sun in Ancient Greek)
	//								1.813,186... => 1 cycle [a whole number]. of light [Sun], 186 of 6 written columns => 186000 : approximately speed of light in miles/second
	// 								165+91 = 256 = binary number 100000000 or 2^8 => 186 & 2^8 binary[2] number => 186282 miles/second (more precise)
	//								165*91 = 15015 => 1.86282 *10^5 = 186282 miles/second	
	// 								Matrix multiplication: row: [31,30,30], col:[55,55,55] = 31*55+30*55+30*55 = 5005 & Positioning row next to column looks like Babylonian cuniform (10) => 1.86282*10^5 = 186282 miles/second	
	//
	//								~ translation 1st column: "... (9) his law was forgotten, (10) his figure and his insignia (11) had disappeared, (12) and none beheld them. ..."
	//														  Summary: This knowledge was lost.
	//								~ translation 2nd column: " ... (4) and one 'ka' of flour and one 'ka' of sesame wine;  (11) A garden in the district (12) of Alu-eshshu, (13) which is in Babylon, (14) he gave to Shamash ... "
 	//														  Summary: What is needed to get back what was lost => flour: light beam visible through airborne flour; sesame wine: time and glass; garden: rotating seasons in space (metaphors for lack of a better word)
	//								~ translation 3rd column: "... (19) A model of his image, (20) fashioned in clay, (21) his figure and his insignia, (22) on the opposite side (23) of the Euphrates, (24) on the western bank, (25) were found ... "
	//						        						  Summary: image of the phenomenon of light (God Shamash) is visible across the Euphrates

	//								...
	//								...
	//								~ translation 6th column: 
	//														  Summary: Don't lose this information.	
	//								~ long length of description is for the reader to realize that the writer is writing for row number, just look at number of rows and do a quick numerical caluclation											
	//	
	// 								mechanism appears similar to:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau%27s_measurement_of_the_speed_of_light_in_air    &       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8NYHa_3xxg
	//								~note Shamash holds a circle and rod : rotation speed and linear distance of experiment necessary to calculate speed of light
